# Elective Course Delete Feature Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds the ability for admins to delete elective courses with a mock delete function until the API is ready. The feature includes delete buttons on both list and detail pages, a confirmation dialog, and toast notifications.

## Issue Reference
Closes #149: Add Delete Elective Course Action (mock delete)

## Changes Made

### 1. New Files Created

#### `/src/lib/elective-course-data.ts`
- **Purpose**: Contains elective course data structure and mock functions
- **Key Components**:
  - `ElectiveCourseData` interface: Defines the structure for elective courses
  - `electiveCourses` array: Mock data with 5 sample elective courses
  - `mockDeleteElectiveCourse()`: Simulates API delete with 500ms delay
  - `getElectiveCourseById()`: Helper function to retrieve a course by ID

#### `/src/components/DeleteCourseDialog.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Reusable confirmation dialog for course deletion
- **Features**:
  - Alert icon with visual warning
  - Course title display
  - Cancel and Delete buttons
  - Loading state during deletion
  - Uses Radix UI Dialog component for accessibility

#### `/src/components/ElectiveCourseCard.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Course card component with delete functionality
- **Features**:
  - Similar to existing CourseCard but with admin delete button
  - Trash icon button in top-right corner of card
  - Integrated delete confirmation dialog
  - Toast notification on successful deletion
  - Supports different variants (default, featured, compact)
  - Responsive design with hover effects

#### `/src/app/dashboard/admin/elective-courses/page.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Admin page listing all elective courses
- **Features**:
  - Grid layout displaying all elective courses
  - Delete button on each course card
  - Empty state when no courses exist
  - Admin notice explaining mock functionality
  - Breadcrumb navigation back to dashboard
  - Placeholder "Add New Course" button (disabled)

#### `/src/app/dashboard/admin/elective-courses/[id]/page.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Detailed view of a single elective course
- **Features**:
  - Full course information display
  - Hero image section
  - Course stats (duration, students, rating)
  - Features and benefits list
  - Tags display
  - Delete button in header section
  - Confirmation dialog before deletion
  - Redirects to list page after successful deletion
  - 404 handling for non-existent courses

### 2. Modified Files

#### `/src/components/ui/input.tsx`
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate Input component definition
- **Reason**: Build was failing due to duplicate declarations

#### `/src/app/register/page.tsx`
- **Fix**: Changed import from `@/components/ui/inputt` to `@/components/ui/input`
- **Reason**: Typo in import path

#### `/src/app/settings/page.tsx`
- **Fix**: Changed import from `@/components/ui/inputt` to `@/components/ui/input`
- **Reason**: Typo in import path

#### `/src/app/settings/profile/profile.tsx`
- **Fix**: Changed import from `@/components/ui/inputt` to `@/components/ui/input`
- **Reason**: Typo in import path

## How to Access

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to the admin elective courses page:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/dashboard/admin/elective-courses
   ```

3. Click on any course card to view details:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/dashboard/admin/elective-courses/[courseId]
   ```

## Testing the Feature

### Test Case 1: Delete from List Page
1. Go to `/dashboard/admin/elective-courses`
2. Click the trash icon on any course card
3. Verify confirmation dialog appears
4. Click "Delete Course"
5. ✅ Course should be removed from the list
6. ✅ Success toast should appear

### Test Case 2: Delete from Detail Page
1. Go to `/dashboard/admin/elective-courses`
2. Click "View Details" on any course
3. Click "Delete Course" button in header
4. Verify confirmation dialog appears
5. Click "Delete Course"
6. ✅ Should redirect to list page after 1 second
7. ✅ Success toast should appear
8. ✅ Course should be removed from list

### Test Case 3: Cancel Deletion
1. Initiate deletion from either page
2. Click "Cancel" in the dialog
3. ✅ Dialog should close
4. ✅ Course should remain in the list

### Test Case 4: Empty State
1. Delete all courses from the list
2. ✅ Empty state message should appear
3. ✅ "No Elective Courses" heading should be visible

## Mock Data

The implementation includes 5 sample elective courses:

1. **Web3 Frontend Development** (Intermediate)
2. **Blockchain Data Analytics** (Advanced)
3. **Tokenomics and Token Design** (Intermediate)
4. **DAO Governance and Management** (Advanced)
5. **Applied Cryptography for Blockchain** (Advanced)

Each course has:
- Title, description, and instructor
- Level, duration, and ratings
- Student count and features
- Price and category tags

## Future API Integration

When the real API is ready, replace the mock function in `/src/lib/elective-course-data.ts`:

```typescript
// Current mock implementation
export const mockDeleteElectiveCourse = async (courseId: string) => {
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 500));
  return { success: true, message: `Course "${courseId}" has been successfully deleted.` };
};

// Future API implementation
export const deleteElectiveCourse = async (courseId: string) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/elective-courses/${courseId}`, {
    method: 'DELETE',
  });
  return response.json();
};
```

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 14**: App Router with dynamic routes
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling and responsive design
- **Radix UI**: Dialog component for accessibility
- **Lucide React**: Icons (Trash2, AlertTriangle, etc.)
- **React Hooks**: useState for state management
- **Next Navigation**: useRouter and useParams for routing

## Code Quality

- ✅ TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ✅ ESLint rules followed (warnings resolved)
- ✅ Prettier formatting applied
- ✅ Consistent code style with existing project
- ✅ Reusable component pattern
- ✅ Proper error handling

## Notes

- The "Add New Course" button is intentionally disabled as it's not part of this issue
- The mock delete function always returns success for demonstration purposes
- State management is local to each page (not using global state like Redux/Zustand)
- Admin authentication/authorization is not implemented (to be added separately)

## Screenshots
